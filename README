This is a Chrome extension that adds desktop notifications to hypem.com.

KNOWN BUGS
-Random crashes
-Notification on page load, before a track has started playing

TODO 
-Figure out a better way of handling track changes - vs the existing DOMNodeInserted method. If no other method can be sourced, DOMNodeInserted should be made more elegant by binding the multiple events on track change together.
-Fix the crashing
